## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

1) Since our intercept is significant, we can conclude that most likely vehicle length, ground clearance, and vehicle weight will not provide random variance to our linear model of mpg (see image below).
2) The slope of the linear model is not considered to be zero.  When looking at both the R-squared and the Adjusted R-squared we observe a strong positive relationship (see image below).
3) Our current linear model does predict the mpg of the MechaCar prototypes effectively.  This can be confirmed when looking at our p-value result of 5.35e-11.  This p-value is much smaller than our alpha value of .05 stating that our model will accurately predict the relationship between all of our variables on mpg (see image below).
